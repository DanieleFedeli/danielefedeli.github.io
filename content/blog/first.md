Hello, everyone!

I’m **Daniele Fedeli**, and I’m a *software engineer*. I started my journey when I was around **12 years old**. I remember following some HTML.it tutorials about JavaScript and PHP, then giving up after encountering intimidating words like `return` and `echo`, thinking I’d *never* understand programming.

Fast forward six years, I enrolled in a **Software Engineering** program at university. *What a trip!* I remember that during the first year we spent roughly **75% of our time on mathematics**. Even though I like math, I complained a lot:

> *“Why don’t they teach us ReactJS or AngularJS, like companies want?”*

What I failed to understand back then is that university, especially the course I chose, wasn’t meant to teach the *latest technologies*, but to **shape our minds** and give us the *forma mentis* needed to solve **complex problems**. I’m truly thankful to have picked this path.

I’ve had several jobs and explored many technologies. *In the end*, what gave me the most satisfaction was the **JavaScript ecosystem**. I’ve solved many problems and failed *plenty of times*, but that’s what we call **experience** in this field.

In this blog, I’ll mainly write about *what I discover*, or tell stories about **how my team and I solved certain problems**. I have *many ideas* in mind.

_Stay tuned!_
